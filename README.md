# [Rock, Paper, Scissor Game](http://christianpena9.github.io/rock-paper-scissor-project/)

I re-created a rock, paper, scissor game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The games logic was created all with JavaScript from the random pick for AI and keeping track on who won the game.

## How to Play

Usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V).

## Creator

Rock, Paper, Scissor Game was built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat). I also used a [Small Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/small-business/) template by [David Miller](https://twitter.com/davidmillerskt).
